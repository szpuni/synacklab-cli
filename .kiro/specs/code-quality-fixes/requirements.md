# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the systematic resolution of linting errors identified by golangci-lint in the synacklab codebase. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to Go best practices by fixing all identified linting issues while maintaining existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all gofmt formatting issues resolved, so that the codebase maintains consistent formatting standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN the system SHALL report zero gofmt violations
2. WHEN any Go file is examined THEN it SHALL be properly formatted according to gofmt standards
3. WHEN the linting pipeline runs THEN it SHALL pass the gofmt check without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused parameters to be properly handled, so that the code is clean and follows Go best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function parameter is unused THEN it SHALL be renamed with an underscore prefix or removed if appropriate
2. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN the system SHALL report zero unused-parameter violations from revive
3. WHEN examining function signatures THEN all parameters SHALL either be used or explicitly marked as unused

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want exported types to follow Go naming conventions, so that the API is consistent and idiomatic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an exported type is defined THEN it SHALL not stutter with its package name
2. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN the system SHALL report zero exported naming violations from revive
3. WHEN external packages import our types THEN the naming SHALL be clear and non-redundant

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all potential nil pointer dereferences to be resolved, so that the application is safe from runtime panics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing pointer fields THEN the system SHALL ensure proper nil checks are in place
2. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN the system SHALL report zero SA5011 staticcheck violations
3. WHEN code executes THEN it SHALL not panic due to nil pointer dereferences

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused functions to be removed or utilized, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function is defined THEN it SHALL either be used or removed if it serves no purpose
2. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN the system SHALL report zero unused function violations
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all functions SHALL have a clear purpose and usage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want HTTP status codes to use standard library constants, so that the code is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP status codes are used THEN they SHALL use http.Status constants instead of magic numbers
2. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN the system SHALL report zero usestdlibvars violations
3. WHEN reviewing HTTP-related code THEN status codes SHALL be self-documenting through named constants
