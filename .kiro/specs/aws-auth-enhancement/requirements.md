# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the AWS authentication capabilities of the synacklab CLI tool by adding proper login functionality and improving the user experience with an interactive fuzzy finder. The enhancement addresses two main areas: restructuring authentication commands to separate login from context switching, and replacing the current number-based selection with an interactive fzf-like interface that supports real-time filtering and keyboard navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to authenticate to AWS SSO with automatic browser opening and seamless flow, so that I don't need to manually copy URLs or wait for manual confirmation steps during authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `synacklab auth aws-login` THEN the system SHALL initiate AWS SSO device authorization flow
2. WHEN the device authorization starts THEN the system SHALL automatically open the verification URL in the default browser
3. WHEN the browser opens THEN the system SHALL continuously poll for authorization completion without requiring user to press Enter
4. WHEN the AWS SSO login is successful THEN the system SHALL store authentication credentials locally
5. WHEN I execute `synacklab auth aws-ctx` THEN the system SHALL allow me to switch between available AWS profiles without re-authenticating
6. IF I am not authenticated to AWS WHEN I execute `synacklab auth aws-ctx` THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating I need to authenticate and automatically proceed to authenticate the user
7. WHEN I execute `synacklab auth aws-ctx --no-auth` THEN the system SHALL skip automatic authentication and exit with an error if not authenticated
8. WHEN I execute `synacklab auth config` THEN the system SHALL display a deprecation warning and redirect to `synacklab auth aws-ctx`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to use the proven fzf library for fuzzy finding instead of a custom implementation, so that I have a reliable, well-tested, and familiar interface for selecting AWS profiles and Kubernetes contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to display a selection interface THEN it SHALL use the fzf library (github.com/junegunn/fzf) as the underlying fuzzy finder
2. WHEN I type characters in the fuzzy finder THEN the system SHALL filter the displayed options in real-time using fzf's proven algorithms
3. WHEN I use arrow keys (up/down) or vim keys (j/k) THEN the system SHALL navigate through the filtered options using fzf's navigation
4. WHEN I press Enter THEN the system SHALL select the currently highlighted option
5. WHEN I press Escape or Ctrl+C THEN the system SHALL cancel the selection and exit gracefully
6. WHEN no options match my filter input THEN fzf SHALL display its standard "No matches found" behavior
7. WHEN the list is empty THEN the system SHALL display "No options available" message
8. WHEN fzf is not available on the system THEN the system SHALL fall back to a simple numbered list selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the authentication command to be renamed from `auth config` to `auth aws-ctx` to better reflect its purpose, so that the command structure is more intuitive and self-documenting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `synacklab auth aws-ctx` THEN the system SHALL provide the functionality previously available under `synacklab auth config`
2. WHEN I execute `synacklab auth config` THEN the system SHALL return a "command not found" error
3. WHEN I use the `--help` flag on auth commands THEN the system SHALL display help text showing `aws-ctx` as the available subcommand
4. WHEN the command is renamed THEN all internal references and documentation SHALL be updated to reflect the new command name

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the authentication system to handle error cases gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback when authentication fails or when I'm not properly authenticated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS SSO authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting guidance
2. WHEN I attempt to switch contexts without being authenticated THEN the system SHALL display an error message directing me to login first
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry suggestions
4. WHEN AWS SSO session expires THEN the system SHALL detect this and prompt me to re-authenticate
5. WHEN authentication credentials are corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL clear them and prompt for fresh authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the fuzzy finder to work consistently across all selection interfaces in the tool, so that I have a uniform experience when selecting AWS profiles, Kubernetes contexts, or any other options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command requires user selection from a list THEN it SHALL use the enhanced fuzzy finder interface
2. WHEN the fuzzy finder is used for AWS profiles THEN it SHALL display profile names and associated account information
3. WHEN the fuzzy finder is used for Kubernetes contexts THEN it SHALL display context names and cluster information
4. WHEN the fuzzy finder displays items THEN it SHALL show relevant metadata to help users make informed selections
5. WHEN the fuzzy finder interface is consistent THEN users SHALL be able to use the same keyboard shortcuts across all selection scenarios
