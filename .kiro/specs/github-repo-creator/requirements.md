# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Repository Reconciler feature will extend the synacklab CLI tool to provide DevOps engineers with a declarative approach to managing GitHub repositories. Using YAML configuration files as the source of truth, this feature will create new repositories or reconcile existing repositories to match the desired state defined in the configuration. This approach enables Infrastructure as Code practices for GitHub repository management, ensuring consistent configuration across repositories and teams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to define repository configuration in a YAML file, so that I can manage repository settings declaratively and maintain them in version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a YAML configuration file THEN the system SHALL support defining repository name, description, visibility, and basic settings
2. WHEN the YAML file contains branch protection rules THEN the system SHALL support defining protection settings for specified branches
3. WHEN the YAML file contains access control settings THEN the system SHALL support defining collaborator and team permissions
4. WHEN the YAML file contains repository features THEN the system SHALL support enabling/disabling issues, wiki, projects, and discussions
5. WHEN the YAML file contains webhook configurations THEN the system SHALL support defining webhook URLs, events, and secrets
6. IF the YAML file is malformed THEN the system SHALL display detailed validation errors with line numbers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to apply a repository configuration file to create or update a GitHub repository, so that the remote repository matches my desired state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `synacklab github apply <config-file.yaml>` THEN the system SHALL read the configuration and apply it to GitHub
2. WHEN the repository does not exist THEN the system SHALL create a new repository with the specified configuration
3. WHEN the repository already exists THEN the system SHALL reconcile the existing repository to match the configuration
4. WHEN applying configuration THEN the system SHALL display a summary of changes being made
5. WHEN the operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display confirmation with repository URL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to reconcile existing repositories with my configuration file, so that I can ensure repositories stay in compliance with organizational policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reconciling an existing repository THEN the system SHALL compare current settings with desired configuration
2. WHEN repository settings differ from configuration THEN the system SHALL update the repository to match the configuration
3. WHEN branch protection rules differ THEN the system SHALL update protection settings to match the configuration
4. WHEN collaborator permissions differ THEN the system SHALL add, remove, or update collaborator access as needed
5. WHEN team permissions differ THEN the system SHALL update team access to match the configuration
6. WHEN webhooks differ THEN the system SHALL create, update, or delete webhooks to match the configuration
7. WHEN repository features differ THEN the system SHALL enable or disable features to match the configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to authenticate with GitHub using secure methods, so that I can manage repositories without exposing credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running any GitHub command THEN the system SHALL check for valid GitHub authentication
2. WHEN GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL use that token for authentication
3. WHEN token is configured in synacklab config file THEN the system SHALL use that token for authentication
4. IF no valid token is found THEN the system SHALL display instructions for setting up authentication
5. IF the token lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL display specific permission requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to preview changes before applying them, so that I can review what will be modified before making actual changes to repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `synacklab github apply <config-file.yaml> --dry-run` THEN the system SHALL show planned changes without applying them
2. WHEN in dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL display what would be created, updated, or deleted
3. WHEN in dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL not make any actual changes to the repository
4. WHEN showing planned changes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the difference between current and desired state
5. WHEN configuration would result in destructive changes THEN the system SHALL highlight those changes prominently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to validate my configuration file before applying it, so that I can catch errors early in my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `synacklab github validate <config-file.yaml>` THEN the system SHALL check the configuration for syntax and logical errors
2. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL display a success message
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with line numbers
4. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL check for required fields and valid values
5. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL verify that referenced users and teams exist in the organization
