# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multi-Repository Management feature extends the existing GitHub Repository Reconciler to support managing multiple repositories from a single YAML configuration file. This enhancement enables DevOps engineers to define and manage entire repository ecosystems declaratively, while maintaining backward compatibility with single repository configurations. The system will treat the YAML file as a state definition where remote repositories are continuously reconciled to match the local configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to define multiple repositories in a single YAML configuration file, so that I can manage related repositories as a cohesive unit and maintain consistency across my repository ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a YAML configuration file with a `repositories` array THEN the system SHALL support defining multiple repository configurations in one file
2. WHEN the YAML file contains both single repository format and multi-repository format THEN the system SHALL detect and handle both formats appropriately
3. WHEN the YAML file uses multi-repository format THEN each repository SHALL support all existing configuration options (name, description, visibility, branch protection, collaborators, teams, webhooks)
4. WHEN the YAML file contains repository-specific settings THEN the system SHALL apply settings independently to each repository
5. WHEN the YAML file contains global defaults THEN the system SHALL apply defaults to all repositories unless overridden at repository level
6. IF the YAML file format is invalid or ambiguous THEN the system SHALL display clear validation errors indicating the expected format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to apply a multi-repository configuration file to create or update multiple GitHub repositories simultaneously, so that I can efficiently manage repository ecosystems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `synacklab github apply <multi-repo-config.yaml>` THEN the system SHALL process all repositories defined in the configuration
2. WHEN repositories do not exist THEN the system SHALL create new repositories with their specified configurations
3. WHEN repositories already exist THEN the system SHALL reconcile existing repositories to match their configurations
4. WHEN processing multiple repositories THEN the system SHALL handle each repository independently and continue processing if one fails
5. WHEN the operation completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing success/failure status for each repository
6. WHEN applying configuration THEN the system SHALL respect GitHub API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with single repository configurations, so that my existing workflows continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use an existing single repository YAML file THEN the system SHALL process it exactly as before
2. WHEN the YAML file contains only single repository fields (name, description, etc.) THEN the system SHALL treat it as a single repository configuration
3. WHEN the YAML file contains a `repositories` array THEN the system SHALL treat it as a multi-repository configuration
4. WHEN using single repository format THEN all existing commands and flags SHALL work identically
5. WHEN migrating from single to multi-repository format THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on format conversion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to define global defaults and repository-specific overrides in my multi-repository configuration, so that I can maintain consistency while allowing customization where needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YAML file contains a `defaults` section THEN the system SHALL apply those settings to all repositories
2. WHEN a repository configuration overrides a default setting THEN the repository-specific setting SHALL take precedence
3. WHEN defaults include branch protection rules THEN repositories SHALL inherit those rules unless they define their own
4. WHEN defaults include collaborators or teams THEN repositories SHALL inherit access controls unless they define their own
5. WHEN defaults include webhooks THEN repositories SHALL inherit webhooks unless they define their own
6. WHEN merging defaults with repository-specific settings THEN the system SHALL use deep merge logic for complex objects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to preview changes across multiple repositories before applying them, so that I can review the impact of my configuration changes across my entire repository ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `synacklab github apply <multi-repo-config.yaml> --dry-run` THEN the system SHALL show planned changes for all repositories without applying them
2. WHEN in dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL display changes grouped by repository with clear repository identification
3. WHEN in dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL show a summary of total changes across all repositories
4. WHEN configuration would result in destructive changes THEN the system SHALL highlight those changes prominently for each affected repository
5. WHEN dry-run encounters errors THEN the system SHALL continue processing other repositories and report all issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to validate my multi-repository configuration file before applying it, so that I can catch configuration errors across all repositories early in my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `synacklab github validate <multi-repo-config.yaml>` THEN the system SHALL validate all repository configurations in the file
2. WHEN validation passes for all repositories THEN the system SHALL display a success message with repository count
3. WHEN validation fails for any repository THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each repository with validation issues
4. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL check for duplicate repository names within the configuration
5. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL verify that all referenced users and teams exist in the organization for each repository
6. WHEN validating defaults and overrides THEN the system SHALL ensure the merged configuration is valid for each repository

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to selectively apply configuration to specific repositories from my multi-repository file, so that I can manage subsets of repositories when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `synacklab github apply <multi-repo-config.yaml> --repos repo1,repo2` THEN the system SHALL only process the specified repositories
2. WHEN using repository selection THEN the system SHALL validate that specified repositories exist in the configuration
3. WHEN using repository selection with dry-run THEN the system SHALL only show changes for selected repositories
4. WHEN using repository selection with validation THEN the system SHALL only validate selected repositories
5. IF specified repository names do not exist in configuration THEN the system SHALL display an error listing invalid repository names

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to handle failures gracefully when managing multiple repositories, so that issues with one repository don't prevent successful management of others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple repositories and one fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining repositories
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL collect and display all errors at the end of processing
3. WHEN partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL return a non-zero exit code indicating partial failure
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL fail fast before processing any repositories
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
6. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which repositories succeeded and which failed
